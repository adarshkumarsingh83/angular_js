Installing Protractor dependencies
-------------------------
Protractor is an end-to-end testing framework used for testing Angular applications.
To install Protractor the following dependencies must be installed in this order:
Download and install NodeJS (http://nodejs.org/download). This installs the NodePackageManager (npm) which you first need to be able to install Protractor.

Add NodeJS and npm to your PATH (if the install hasn't already done that for you) i.e. C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\npm\ and C:\Program Files\nodejs\

Install Protractor using npm:
From command line issue:

Windows
npm install -g protractor [--python=c:\python27]
(the optional python argument is if the version of python on your path is 3.x.) or..

*nix
sudo npm install -g protractor

Note: There is a bug in Windows with the latest version of npm. If when installing Protractor you get the following error "Error: ENOENT, stat 'C:\users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\npm", to fix this you have to manually create the npm directory at this location. See here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25093276/nodejs-windows-error-enoent-stat-c-users-rt-appdata-roaming-npm for more information if needed.

Install the Selenium standalone jar using npm:
From command line, from your nodejs folder (e.g. C:\Program Files\nodejs):

Windows
npm install selenium-server-standalone-jar or..

*nix
sudo npm install selenium-server-standalone-jar

Configure your Maven settings to point to the Selenium standalone jar
-------------------------
Go to your .m2 directory (i.e. C:\Users\<user>\.m2)
Open the settings.xml file (or create the file if it doesn't already exist)
Add this to the contents:
settings.xml
<settings>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>myProfile</id>
      <properties>
        <!-- MAKE SURE THIS PATH REFLECTS THE LOCATION ON YOUR MACHINE-->
        <selenium-standalone-jar.location>C:/PROGRA~1/nodejs/node_modules/selenium-server-standalone-jar/jar/selenium-server-standalone-2.43.1.jar</selenium-standalone-jar.location>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
  <activeProfiles>
    <!--make the profile active all the time -->
    <activeProfile>myProfile</activeProfile>
  </activeProfiles>
</settings>

>npm -version

> npm install -g protractor

NOTE:f you get any error as "Error: ENOENT, stat 'C:\Users\Adarsh\AppData\Roaming\npm.". Please create a folder named 'npm' which will solve your problem.

     And also make sure you navigate to the folder AppData/Roaming/npm and install protractor

     Path may look like C:\Users\Adarsh\AppData\Roaming\npm
     Path may look like C:\Users\Adarsh\AppData\Roaming\npm

     Note: if you are not able to view the AppData folder, request you to view the hidden folders.

     Once that is done, confirm by typing 'protractor --version' in the commend prompt which will show you the protractor version that is installed.
